# Odra Plugin Marketplace

A [Claude Code plugin marketplace](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces) for distributing plugins related to [Odra](https://github.com/odradev/odra) — a Rust-based smart contract framework for Casper Network.

## Available Plugins

### odra-plugin

Streamlines smart contract development with the Odra framework. Gives Claude Code deep knowledge of Odra's APIs, patterns, and tooling so it can help you scaffold, build, and test Odra contracts more effectively.

## Prerequisites

The plugin drives Odra's own toolchain — it does not replace it. Before installing, make sure you have:

- Rust toolchain with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- [`cargo-odra`](https://github.com/odradev/cargo-odra): `cargo install cargo-odra --locked`
- `wasm-strip` ([wabt](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt)) and `wasm-opt`
  ([binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen), **121 or newer** — distribution packages are
  usually too old)

The [Installation guide](https://odra.dev/docs/getting-started/installation) covers all of them, and
there are verified copy-pasteable command lists per platform:
[macOS setup](https://odra.dev/docs/getting-started/macos-setup) and
[Ubuntu / WSL setup](https://odra.dev/docs/getting-started/ubuntu-wsl-setup).
Once the plugin is installed, `/odra-plugin:check-env` verifies the setup for you, and
`/odra-plugin:new-project` scaffolds a project with `cargo odra new`.

## Installation

Add the marketplace and install the plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add odradev/odradev-plugins
/plugin install odra-plugin@odradev-plugins
```

To verify it's active:

```
/plugin list
```

## Updating

Pull the latest version of the marketplace and its plugins:

```
/plugin marketplace update
```

## Project-level setup

To make the plugin available automatically for everyone working on your Odra project, add this to `.claude/settings.json` in your repository:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "odradev-plugins": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "odradev/odradev-plugins"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "odra-plugin@odradev-plugins": true
  }
}
```

Anyone who clones the repo and trusts the project folder will be prompted to install the plugin.

## Keeping the plugin in sync with the docs

`plugins/odra-plugin/reference/docs-map.md` mirrors the structure of
[odra.dev/docs](https://odra.dev/docs) and is what the skills consult when their bundled reference
runs out. When pages are added, renamed or removed on the docs site, update it — the generated
[llms.txt](https://odra.dev/llms.txt) is the authoritative list to check against.
